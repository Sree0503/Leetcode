// PROBLEM OF THE DAY: Longest Substring without Repeating Characters

// APPROACH:
    // 1. The goal is to find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
    // 2. I used a sliding window technique with two pointers (i and j) starting from index 0.
    // 3. A Map is used to store the frequency of characters in the current window.
    // 4. I expand the window using pointer j and add characters to the map until a duplicate character is found.
    // 5. When a duplicate is found, I shrink the window from the left using pointer i and decrement the frequency
    //    of characters until the duplicate is removed from the window.
    // 6. During expansion, I update the maximum length of the substring.
    // 7. Finally, I return the maximum length.

// TIME COMPLEXITY: O(N log N)

// SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(1)

        map<char,int>mpp;
        while(j<n){
            if(mpp[s[j]]==0){
                mpp[s[j]]++;
                max_len= max(max_len, j-i+1);
                j++;
            } else {
               mpp[s[i]]--;
               i++;
            }
        }
        return max_len;
